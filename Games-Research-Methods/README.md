### SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT 1: PROJECT PROPOSAL

Weighting
80%

Details:  
As you might be aware, your undergraduate Honours Project is a year-long independent research project that you will undertake in a subject area linked to your field of study. 
To help prepare for this project, you will develop a 2000-word research proposal that outlines the project you want to do. The proposal’s theme should typically be linked to an
 academic member of staff within the School of EAST, and be related to what you have learned on your degree.

You have been tasked with writing a 2000-word research proposal.

Learning Outcomes Assessed:  
- Understand the relationship between research ideas and the formulation of testable hypotheses  
- Communicate research ideas and findings in a variety of formats to specialist and non-specialist audiences  
- Understand the application of an appropriate statistical test to a given experiment, hypothesis or dataset  
- Understand ethical considerations relating to research design  
- Requirements specification 

Your proposal should meet the following requirements:

Be written in an academic style – don’t write like this: “so basically I decided to research games because I like the subject”  
Write in third person – so no use of “I did this, I did that” etc  
2000 words with 10% leeway over/under. References and any headings do not count towards this.  
A background/literature review  
Project objective – a one sentence goal of the project (or one bullet point for each goal)  
Key questions – a bullet point list of questions you may wish to answer/investigate throughout your project  
A set of hypotheses – this may be weaved into your background or made explicit in its own heading  
Methodology – Describe how you will answer those questions. For example, this could be through the development of a game scenario that requires playtesters. 
What would be the requirements be for playtesters? Experienced gamers, older adults, etc? How do you plan to test your artefact? Will the playtesters be given the same scenario or have something different?  
Predicted results if applicable – e.g. do you expect your artefact to have effect X or Y on your playtesters? How might you analyse your results?  
A list of references related to your topic, the majority of which should be from credible academic sources and formatted in the UoS Harvard style  
Use in-text referencing when referring to an item from your reference list  
A consideration of research ethics  
Optional 300 word lay summary that summarises the proposal to the general public  
This proposal should be formatted well and easy to read. Consider proofreading often, and have each paragraph flow in a logical way. Reference often and try your best to relate your project to the existing literature. 
Use the literature to help give justification and motivation for your study, whilst simultaneously demonstrating that you have read and understood your area of interest! In the event that you find yourself going over
 the word count, take a break and proofread with a fresh pair of eyes. You’d be amazed at how many sentences you find that are overly long and can be shortened. Also, you do not need to spend paragraphs for space 
explaining the literature you’d read. Instead, take the time to briefly summarise work and then put them into the context of your proposal. To help with this, try to work on your proposal throughout the semester, 
revising pieces as you go. Finally, read the introduction sections of academic papers to get a feel for what a brief literature review looks like.

### SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT 2: PROJECT PRESENTATION

Details:  
You will engage with a project presentation that outlines the proposed research project. This presentation will be 5 – 10 minutes in length and focuses on quality over quantity. Do not fill the time with extra
 padding just to fill time. You want to be confident and explain very clearly what your project is going to be about, the field of research you have been engaging with, and your overall methodology for the project.

You have been tasked with a 5 – 10 minute long presentation.

In addition to your main 5-10 minute presentation, you will also engage with smaller presentations across the module, the individual contributions of which will be submitted at the end of the module together with 
your final presentation. 

Your presentation should meet the following requirements:

Presented confidently. Webcam is not essential, but preferred (you won’t lose marks for not having a webcam)  
An introduction to your project, e.g. what is it all about?  
Discuss the field of research you have chosen  
For example, if your dissertation is on analyzing the effects of audio on player experience, you’ll want to introduce the field of player experience to the viewer. You should also introduce audio in games  
Provide a reason for you doing this project  
Discuss your thoughts and what you have read that lead you to thinking up this project?  
Describe your hypotheses or research questions here  
Discuss how you’re going to go about doing this project  
Is it a tool you’re making? Discuss your plans to build the tool, if it requires iteration, what the tool is going to get built in etc.  
Is it an experiment? Discuss your experimental design (e.g. within subjects) and the type of data collection you’ll use (e.g. quantitative, mixed methods etc)  
Some combination of the above or something else? Take your time and carefully describe your methodology  
Discuss the “end result” of your dissertation. What will your dissertation look like once you submit? If you are collecting any data, spend some time predicting what those results might look like  
This assignment goes hand in hand with your research proposal. Discussing what your research will be about should be fairly straightforward if you’ve been writing your proposal. Conversely, 
if you have spent time preparing this presentation then it’s a case of translating what you have into written form.
