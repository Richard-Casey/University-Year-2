**Module Grade: 62% – Upper Second-Class Honours**  
**Proposal Grade: 66% | Presentation Grade: 57%**

This module formed part of the second-year curriculum at the University of Suffolk and was designed to help prepare for the final year dissertation by exploring academic research methods, project design, and hypothesis formulation within the context of game development and player experience.

This is a **non-coding academic module**, included here to reflect the breadth of the second-year curriculum and show the applied research and communication skills developed alongside technical modules.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This module helped me prepare for the independent research and planning required in my final year dissertation, building confidence in academic writing, research framing, and presenting complex ideas in accessible formats.

While not a code-based module, it complements my technical work by demonstrating critical thinking, planning, and reflective practice — all key skills in the games industry.
