These tools MUST contain:  
1. An interface to adjust settings for the game objects in the scene (Details panel)  
2. The ability to select objects in the scene and move them around  
3. A window listing the assets in your game  
4. Ability to drag those assets in to the scene.  
5. A scene hierarchy interface  
6. Ability to parent and parent objects to each other in the hierarchy  
7. A performance stats window and profiler window  
8. Save and load functionality  

For higher grades, you will need to provide  
- Excellent documentation (See unity’s documentation for the “gold standard” of
documentation)  
- High quality code (including naming conventions and code cleanliness.)  
- High level of polish to the final peace, including User interface considerations. (On par with
commercial game engines.)  
- An element of personal research (Your own custom editor utility or explorer like
functionality in the asset window for instance)
