# Artificial Intelligence for Games â€“ Predator/Prey Simulation in C++

**Module Grade: 54% â€“ Lower Second Class (2:2)**  
**Report Grade: 55%**  
**Project Grade: 53%**

This project was developed as part of the second-year *Artificial Intelligence for Games* module at the University of Suffolk. The assessment was split into two parts: a written research report and a technical simulation demonstrating multiple AI behaviours in a game context.

Despite being one of my more challenging modules, it gave me a valuable foundation in AI systems and programming logic that I've since built upon in later projects.

## ðŸ§© Key Components

- `State.h / State.cpp` â€“ Manages agent states and transitions
- `AStarPathFinding.h / .cpp` â€“ Grid-based pathfinding algorithm
- `Behaviour.h / .cpp` â€“ Behaviour Tree node system
- `Hunter`, `Prey`, `BaseEntity` â€“ Core AI actors
- `GridManager` â€“ Manages navgrid and spatial layout

## ðŸŽ® How to Run

Navigate to the `/Build` directory and run `AIFramework.exe`.  
Assets are located in `/Build/Assets/` and loaded automatically at runtime.

## ðŸŽ“ Reflection

This module challenged my C++ problem-solving and understanding of AI logic structures. While I found it difficult at the time, it sparked a deeper interest in systems design, and Iâ€™ve since improved significantly in building logic-based systems in games.

The skills learned here laid a foundation I continued to develop in later projects like Tools Programming and gameplay systems in my dissertation work.

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates:
- A working knowledge of core game AI systems
- Honest progress in an area Iâ€™ve worked hard to improve
- My ability to complete a complex technical brief, even when outside my comfort zone
