# Group Project (Year 2) – Top-Bird (Unity Card Game)

**Final Module Grade: 72% – First Class Honours**  
**Group Game (Solo Submission): 63%**  
**Individual Contributions: 74%**

This project was part of the second-year *Group Project* module at the University of Suffolk. It was originally designed to be a collaborative effort involving designers and programmers from both year 1 and year 2, based on a pitch system where students voted on games proposed by the designers.

I was assigned to a game titled **Top-Bird**, a Unity-based card game prototype — despite not choosing this brief in my top three preferences. The module structure placed the original GDD author as group lead, but unfortunately, they did not contribute to or communicate with the team. Of the six group members, I was the only programmer and ultimately the only person to complete any development work.

## ⚠️ Group Breakdown & Resubmission

Due to the original project being **non-runnable** and incomplete at the submission deadline, the game component of the module failed. However, my individual contributions received a **First (74%)**, demonstrating significant effort and professionalism.

After appealing to the university board with time-stamped proof of my work, I was granted an additional **10-day extension** to rebuild a fully playable version of *Top-Bird* **entirely solo**. This version of the game was assessed independently and scored **63%**, allowing my overall module grade to reach **72%** (First).

The university confirmed that this work would be assessed as a **solo effort**, and I was considered a group of one.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This module taught me more about professionalism, problem-solving, and resilience than any other. While the situation was far from ideal, I proved I could adapt, stay professional, and still deliver a complete project under pressure.

*Top-Bird* may have started as a failed group effort, but it became one of my proudest solo achievements.
