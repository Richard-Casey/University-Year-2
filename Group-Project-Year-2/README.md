## SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT 1: INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO OF CONTRIBUTIONS
Weighting
80%

Details:  
Throughout this semester, you will be participating in the game development process through a semester long game development project. 
This will show your ability to estimate and control project resources, implement and execute test plans on an ongoing basis, 
communicate game and individual progress in a consistent and effective manner, including the ability to pitch. Use of documentation
 and software related to project management will also be demonstrated in addition to your ability to reflect on work and identify best practices on a range of issues.
You have been tasked with compiling the work you have done throughout the semester.

Requirements specification:  
Your portfolio submission should meet the following requirements:

Submitted as a single zipped up file with an easy to navigate folder structure (see Figure 1 below)
Please provide a screencast (video) that shows the work you have done. You may voice over this, or 
have a silent recording, so long as you go through each item YOU have worked on.

The portfolio should be easy to navigate and contain all the work you have worked on. As this folder might exceed the upload limit for a Brightspace submission,
 it is also acceptable to upload the work to your University OneDrive account, and instead submit a .txt (text) file with the download link inside. Please ensure
 your work is timestamped.

Learning Outcomes Assessed:  
Produce a game within identifiable constraints through an iterative approach to game production.  
Plan, estimate and control the resource requirements for small projects on an ongoing basis.  
Demonstrate intermediate level knowledge in the use of appropriate project management software to devise quality management systems for small projects.  
Proactively maintain communication and reflect on a game’s development within a small development team.  

## SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT 2: THE GAME
Details:  
This assignment will demonstrate your ability to complete a game against an initial design specification. Quality of gameplay experience, iterative development
 of the game and ability to satisfy an identified market through appropriate gameplay design will be examined. The game will be completed as a group, and therefore
 group marks will be given to each student. For example, if a game is considered passable at 65%, all students who made that game, and provided evidence of individual
 contributions, will receive 65% for this assessment.

You have been tasked with developing a game within a team across the whole semester.

Requirements specification:
Your portfolio submission should meet the following requirements:

A submission zone will be available in the Brightspace module area, and in the Assignments section. Please submit a text file following this name format:  
[team name] [game name]  
Within this file, provide a link to your game which will be uploaded to an itch.io page provided  
A gameplay video   

Length - 5 to 10 minutes long. Quality over quantity (hitting 10 exactly doesn't mean more marks, it’s mainly to give you scope for your team to fully contribute)  
Screencast your presentation via OBS or something similar. Webcam isn't necessary but voice over is  
Ideally submit as one presentation but if you can't figure out how to do this due to the lockdown, then separate screencasts is fine. Just create a README on the view 
order and upload them all together. The README is important so that I don't miss anyone by mistake!  
Please pitch your game as if you are pitching to potential players and investors. You want me to be excited about the game. Please do not talk about the dev process and how 
hard it was to fix a bug etc. Get me hyped!  
If you are finding it difficult to upload the presentation, then please upload an unlisted youtube video and submit the URL to it  
Please record some gameplay footage and make that present somewhere in the presentation.  
It's really up to you how you structure it! Get creative and involve everyone  
At a minimum, your team lead needs to voice over as they are acting as project managers, but you all need to contribute to the presentation in some way.  
To reiterate, it's not such a good idea to talk about how you made assets etc. It's more important to talk about how the decisions you made and assets you developed steered 
the game in the direction you wanted. You should try to think, "how will this presentation excite players?".

It's time for you all to think about what you've done and how to utilise your design and development knowledge to empower you to talk about the game in professional terms.

For designers, it's now time to take what you've been learning in Design Methods and Introduction to Non-Digital Game Design and show me what you've learned. Mention the game's core loop, mention any other loops you may have integrated. Think about how you've designed the game and what makes it tick. For programmers, you can go into detail about the game's mechanics and any systems you have created. Talk about all the decisions a player can make and actions they can perform within your games.

Think about the emotions you wanted to evoke and how you wanted the player to feel. Being able to discuss what you've created in this way will be far more valuable to you than to simply reel off what you've worked on. Of course, you can introduce yourself as the gameplay programmer, level designer etc, but don't make the presentation just about that.
