# Individual Contributions

This project should be prefixed with the fact that as a team of 6, I was the only contributor to the project, with 4 of the remaining 5 members
permanently abesent from development session. The remaining member refused to complete any work and decided to let the project fail.

As a result i did as much work as was necessasary for myself to pass and then appealed the decision based on the fact that i shouldnt be resonsabile for 5 other members worth of work.

The appeal was successful and the committee allowed me to resubmit the game as the sole contributor which would then not contribute to the other group members score.

I then completed the game myself and resubmitted in time for the committees deadline.

These individual contributions are based on the original version of the game when i was resonsabile for 5 other people, as this part of the module passed i was unable to resubmit.

The game submitted to this repository is the revised verson post appeal.
