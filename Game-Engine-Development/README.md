Game Engine Development:

Having written your engine design document, use it as the basis for developing an
implementation of your engine. All the code you write must be in C++ (unless for scripting
language purposes), you are encouraged to follow the C++11 standards and it may be worth
looking at something like the google C++ style guide for a reference as to how to present
your code.

You must write a set of documentation for your engine, it should provide a clear API
reference (you may want to look at the Unreal / Unity documentation for inspiration) which,
ideally, should be generated from the code itself.

You should develop a small proof of concept game that makes use of your engine to
demonstrate it is fit for purpose. This proof of concept should be included in your
submission with any required assets.

Minimum engine requirements:  
Renderer  
Input manager  
Resource manager  
Scene management  
Demo game  
Your demo game must contain the following.  
A movable player  
A reasonable goal  
At least one level  
At least one enemy AI (this does not need to be complex)  
At least on pick up item
